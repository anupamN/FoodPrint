    <p>
      Here at CarbonFOODprint we aim raise awareness and support of 
      Food related carbon emissions from Australian communities and 
      ask for the inclusion of a Carbon FOODprint Label on all foods.
    </p>
    <h2>What is CarbonFOODprint?</h2>
    <p>Do you know how far your food has travelled to get to you? Have 
      you seen the standards of factories where they came from? Do you 
      wonder why we do not source more products locally?
    </p>
    <p>
    You may not be aware, but where your food comes fromimpacts the world. 
    You may not pay at the checkout, but you pay in excess fuel emissions 
    from planes, from trash being dumped overseas, and with waste from 
    animal grazing
    </p>
    <p>Our end goal is to hand over the petition and lobby to the government 
      agencies; to the Minister of Environment & Energy and the Minister of 
      Primary Industries (Food Standards Australia/NZ)
